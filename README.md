sRaidFrames_Improved
====================

sRaidFrames

This version of sRaidFrames supports 40 yard range check
- 40y range check is only limited to healing classes due its mechanism
- 40y range check require certain spells to be on actionbar(you will be noticed by message if spell missing)
- 40y range check is compatible with standard blizzard target frame, using any others unit_frame addons may cause target flicking and small perfomance drop

I've implemented Grid like healing Indicators - indicators can be colored differently, it depends on how many heals are casted on unit at same time
- green: 1
- yellow: 2
- orange: 3
- red: 4 and more
