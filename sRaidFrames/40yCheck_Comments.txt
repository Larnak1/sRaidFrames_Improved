- after enabling extended rage check you you'll have to wait around 15s to apply changes
- 40y range check is only limited to healing classes due its mechanism
- 40y check may cause small issues with displaying dropdowns like: Inspect Frame/Context Menus etc to prevent them from disappearing press Shift key(range check will be disabled temporarily until key release)
- 40y range check require certain spells to be on actionbar(you will be noticed by message if spell missing)
- in some situations gui performance may be reduced
