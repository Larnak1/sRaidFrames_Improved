- 40y range check is only limited to healing classes due its mechanism
- 40y range check require certain spells to be on actionbar(you will be noticed by message if spell missing)
- 40y range check is compatible with standard blizzard target frame, using any others unit_frame addons may cause target flicking and small perfomance drop
